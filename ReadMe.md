MMCA represents the field of multimodal collaboration analytics which utilizes different sensor technologies to gain insights into the group's behavior during group work to enhance the group's collaboration.

We present the current state-of-the-art in MMCA with our extensive literature review of research studies published since 2000. The review offers insights into the current trends in MMCA, challenges faced by researchers, and research areas where more research efforts are needed. 

This repository primarily contains two main components

* **MMCA Review library**: This library aims to allow easier access to our literature review dataset through Python. Additionally, the library also provides some utility functions, e.g., filtering papers based on a time interval, and plotting trends for different coded attributes of papers (e.g., metrics, outcomes). <br/> Read the documentation [here](https://github.com/hgse-schneider/mmca-visualizations/blob/main/MMCA_library.md) <br/><br/> Check some analysis examples [here](https://github.com/hgse-schneider/mmca-visualizations/blob/main/source_codes/Trends.ipynb)

* **Dashboard Generator**: The dashboard generator utilizes the MMCA review library and generates a web-based dashboard for the users. The dashboard allows users to explore the review dataset in terms of metric-outcome relationships, and filter papers as per their needs. <br/> Read [here](https://github.com/hgse-schneider/mmca-visualizations/blob/main/Dashboard.md) the steps to generate the dashboard
